# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, commonly referred to as opinion mining, is the technique of identifying and extracting subjective information from text by using computational linguistics, natural language processing, and text analysis. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude, opinions, and emotions of a speaker or writer towards a particular topic or issue. Sentiment analysis has a wide range of uses. It can be used to track brand or product mentions on social media and to gather feedback from the public. It can also be used in customer service to quickly and accurately identify customer sentiment and to improve the customer experience. In addition, sentiment analysis can be used in market research to understand consumer sentiment towards a particular product or service, and to inform marketing and business strategy. There are several challenges in sentiment analysis, including the subjectivity of language, the use of irony and sarcasm, and the presence of negation words. In addition, there is often a lack of annotated training data, which can make it difficult to accurately train machine learning models. Despite these challenges, sentiment analysis has the potential to provide valuable insights and to improve various business and social applications. In this project, a sentiment analysis algorithm that utilizes both machine learning and deep learning techniques were presented.
